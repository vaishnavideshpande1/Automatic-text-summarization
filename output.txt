As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License.Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since merged into Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of Java as free and open-source software, (FOSS), under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009Â–2010, Oracle has described itself as the "steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency".Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995.Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee.As of 2015, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of Java's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.
